			The jgl distribution comes with a sample psiTurk project called gorilla-experiment. This tutorial
			will show you around the project, and make sure that you know what all the folders are and how
			to organize your project when using jgl.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			Inside the project folder there are three main files/folders to pay attention to. config.txt, static, and
			templates. Below I will go over each one of these:
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			First there is the config.txt file. Most of the information inside this file will never change,
			since it has been setup to work with the Heeger lab information. There are two main lines however
			that may, the database information. These two lines are database_url and table_name. The database_url
			is in the form of mysql://&lt;username>:&lt;password>@&lt;address>:&lt;port>/&lt;databasename>. The username
			and password are the login information for the mysql database. The address is almost always going to be 127.0.0.1 
			which means local host. The port is also almost always 3306 which is the standard mysql port number. The
			database however can be changed to your liking. By default it is psiturk, but you can name it whatever you want.
			The table_name is the name of the table to use inside the database. This should be specific to each experiment 
			you run.
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			The next thing to talk about is the static folder. This folder is where everything that is used by your website
			is stored except for the html pages themselves. By default there are four folders inside static, css, images, js, and
			lib. css is where all of your stylesheets should go, images is where all the images should go, for example an NYU logo image.
			js is where task.js is found by default, and where your custom jgl experiment javascript file will go. And lib is where
			the three jgl files need to live, jgllib.js, KeyboardJS.js, and jglTask.js. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			The last folder is templates. This is where all of the html files should go. There are several already there by
			default such as error.html, consent.html, ad.html, exp.html, complete.html as well as others. All of your experiments
			html files should go in here. There is also a sub-folder of templates called instructions. This is where your instruction
			pages for your experiment should go. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			It is very important to maintain a clean and organized project folder so that as the project grows all of the files will
			be easy to find.
