			Surveys are something that were not in mgl at all and therefore I felt the need
			to discuss how they work at length. Surveys, unlike normal stimulus phases do not
			have a fixed length, that being said they actually do run with the same trial-segment
			structure of any other phase. The difference is that surveys have an infinite number
			of blocks and trials and therefore will run indefinitely until stopped artificially. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Another major difference between surveys and stimulus phases are the integration with
			and html page that needs to be customized. This will require the knowledge of both
			html and how JavaScript / jQuery interact with html elements to make custom survey pages.
			In the gorilla example there are four different survey pages that all work very similarly,
			and here I will discuss what is done in them. I will assume you know basic html, however,
			will not assume the knowledge of jQuery or manipulation of html elements with JavaScript. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There are three important JavaScript based parts to a survey page. Requiring the competition of
			fields, the saving of data, and the advancing of the phase. All three of these things conveniently
			need to happen when the done button is pressed. For this tutorial we will use survey.html as our example. 
			Below is all of the JavaScript in survey.html, I will go through it piece by piece and explain it. 
		</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
$("#but_done").click(function() {
	var full = true;
	$("#screenSize, #ratio").each(function() {
		if (! $(this).val()) {
			full = false;
			$(this).css("background-color", "red");
		}
	});
	if (full) {
		var height = screen.height;
		var angle;
		if ($("#ratio").val() == "wide") {
			angle = 0.512393762;
		} else if($("#ratio").val() == "standard") {
			angle = 0.6435;
		}

		var inHeight = $("#screenSize").val() * Math.sin(angle);
		myscreen.ppi = height / inHeight;

		jglData.demographics = {};
		if ($("age").val()) {
			jglData.demographics.age = $("#age").val();
		} else {
			jglData.demographics.age = -1;
		}
		if ($("#gender").val()) {
			jglData.demographics.gender = $("#gender").val();
		} else {
			jglData.demographics.gender = "";
		}

		nextPhase();
	}
});

$(":input").not("#but_done").click(function() {
	$(this).css("background-color", "white");
});
		
		</pre>
		
		<p>
			First I will talk about binding a click event. line 1, says when the element
			with id="but_done" gets clicks run this function. In this case, the function
			that is run goes all the way to line 35. The first thing that happens is this block
			of code:
		</p>
		
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
	var full = true;
	$("#screenSize, #ratio").each(function() {
		if (! $(this).val()) {
			full = false;
			$(this).css("background-color", "red");
		}
	});
		</pre>
		
		<p>
			This block of code runs this anonymous function for both the element with id="screenSize" and
			id="ratio". It checks to see if they are empty, if they are it sets full to false and turns their
			background color to red to signify there incompletion.  
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The next block of code is in charge of saving the information as well as advancing the phase. Here it is:
		</p>
		
		<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
	if (full) {
		var height = screen.height;
		var angle;
		if ($("#ratio").val() == "wide") {
			angle = 0.512393762;
		} else if($("#ratio").val() == "standard") {
			angle = 0.6435;
		}

		var inHeight = $("#screenSize").val() * Math.sin(angle);
		myscreen.ppi = height / inHeight;

		jglData.demographics = {};
		if ($("age").val()) {
			jglData.demographics.age = $("#age").val();
		} else {
			jglData.demographics.age = -1;
		}
		if ($("#gender").val()) {
			jglData.demographics.gender = $("#gender").val();
		} else {
			jglData.demographics.gender = "";
		}

		nextPhase();
	}
		</pre>
		
		<p>
			This is only run if full, aka if both screenSize and ratio were filled when but_done was pressed. 
			Here several different things happen, myscreen.ppi gets set to the appropriate value, and the demographic data gets saved
			in the jglData object. Then after all of that, the phase is advanced. Lets take a look at the first part, the setting of
			myscreen.ppi. Here the ratio is used to determine the angle between the diagonal and the side which can then be used in conjunction
			with the length of the diagonal in inches and the length of the side in pixels to determine the ppi of the screen. The results
			of this calculation is then saved in myscreen.ppi and used by jgl when calling jglOpen. It is esential that myscreen.ppi is set
			before jglOpen is called. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			After myscreen.ppi is set, the demographics data is stored. Here is where some changes may be desired. It is possible to assume that
			different demographic data will be desired and all that is needed is additional input fields to be included in the html, as well as 
			additional JavaScript to save the data before advancing. Here, since demographic data is not required the value of the field must be
			checked for null values, if they are null a placeholder is placed instead. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Once all of the data is saved the phase is advanced by calling nextPhase. It is important to realize that nextPhase advances all tasks
			in the experiment. Tasks in the experiments must be phase locked since each phase has a different html page and it is impossible to show
			different ones at the same time.
