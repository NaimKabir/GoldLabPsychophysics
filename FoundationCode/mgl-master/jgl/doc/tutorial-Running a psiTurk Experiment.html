			There are three different ways that psiTurk experiments can be viewed/run.
			On AMT, in debug mode, and on a web browser as a normal website detached from 
			AMT. This tutorial will teach you how to start up the psiTurk server and then
			run your experiment in these three different ways. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			First off lets talk about booting the server. This is done from the psiTurk
			command line. To access the command line navigate to your project folder and
			type the command <span class="prettyprint">psiturk</span>. This will open the 
			command line for psiturk. Once there, use the command <span class="prettyprint">
			server on</span> to turn on the server, make sure that the host address in config.txt
			is set to 0.0.0.0. <b>NOTE:</b> the command <span class="prettyprint">
			server off</span> turns off the server and the command <span class="prettyprint">exit</span>
			brings you back to the normal UNIX command line. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			Once the server is on you now can view the experiment for debugging purposes. This is
			done by typing the command <span class="prettyprint">debug</span> this will launch your
			default browser and bring you to the experiment ad page. This is one way to view the experiment
			it is used for debugging and is very useful but will also come in handy for using the website
			without the help of AMT. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			Now that you know how to view the experiment lets talk about how to run it. There are two ways to
			run the experiment the first is the usual way using AMT, and the second is as a standalone website.
			Lets talk first about using AMT and then I will go into using the experiment as a standalone website. 
			To run the experiment on AMT you need to first switch the server mode to live, this is done with the
			<span class="prettyprint">live</span> command. <b>NOTE:</b> this should only be done after first testing
			the experiment in sandbox mode, the process for creating the hit is the same for sandbox mode, but should
			be done before going live. Once you are live you type the command <span class="prettyprint">hit create</span>
			and then fill in the information, number of participants, reward, and time. <b>NOTE:</b> I was told to not
			run more than 100 people with one hit at one time. So run in blocks of 100. Once you finish inputing the values
			for hit create you are done. Make sure to <b>pay</b> the turkers after running the experiment. Simply putting
			in the reward value doesnt give them any money. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			The second way to run an experiment is as a standalone website. This is a bit tricky and there is probably a
			better way to do it then what I am about to explain. Once the server is on the website can be accessed from anywhere
			assuming the host computer is globally accessible. The only issue with just directly accessing the website is that 
			psiTurk requires several fields in the URL that are given to it by AMT. This can be faked in two ways. The first is to
			use the debug command, this will generate a URL and if done a lot many personalized URLs can be created. The second
			way could be to have a site that randomly generates these params and then redirects to the website with those params.
