			psiTurk has been installed on the visionmini. To install it elsewhere I refer you to 
			<a href="http://psiturk.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html"> psiTurk's installation guide</a>. 
			I do however have a couple of comments and suggestion with this process. First off, make sure to get
			Enthough, its talked about in the installation guide, it is needed. Next off, do that first, then install
			pip using the get_pip.py instructions they provide. Next, use sudo to install psiTurk. And finally, I found
			that to integrate psiTurk with a MySQL database I needed one last thing, the following command:
			<pre class="prettyprint">
sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/libmysqlclient.18.dylib /usr/lib/libmysqlclient.18.dylib
			</pre>
			This setup my environment correctly, though it was a painful process so hopefully it works smoothly for you.

			Once psiturk is installed their <a href="http://psiturk.org/quick_start/">quick start guide </a>is quite helpful.
			One thing that is important, if this is to be a simple debugging psiturk install, the AWS credentials mentioned in
			the guide are not necessary. As for the psiturk API credentials I beleive the are required, they can be recovered either
			by copying the ones on the visionmini, or by logging onto a psiturk.org account. 
		</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
		<p>
			Here is how to setup a turk experiment: like in the quick start guide, use psiturk-setup-example to get all of the basic
			files necessary for a turk experiment. Then there will be some changes that are needed. consent.html, exp.html, and ad.html
			all need to be copied over from the gorilla example. <br>NOTE: ad.html may need some changes since it lists the amount of time
			the experiment will take, as well as how much it pays out. additional, exp.html will need to be changed to include the correct
			name of your jgl experiment file, not alttrialexperiment.js.<br>Once that is all setup and your jgl experiment file is included
			in static/js then all that is needed are all of the referenced html files. These will be explained in the next section. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div>
		<p>
			The html pages that get displayed during the experiment are different than most html pages, they only contain the inside of a 
			body tag. This is because psiTurk injects them into the body tag of exp.html when showPages is called. There is one special html
			page in the gorilla example, canvas.html. This page is required for all stimuli phases. This is due to the specially named div within
			it so that jglOpen can correctly inject canvas elements. Every other html page to be used during the experiment can be customized,
			 though I would recommend using survey.html as a demographic survey because remember, screen data is <b>REQUIRED!</b>.
