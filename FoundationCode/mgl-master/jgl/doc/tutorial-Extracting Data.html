			In this tutorial I will teach you how to extract all of the data that was gathered using
			psiturk with your experiment. Now, you should know from reading the psiturk guide that all
			of your data is saved in the database and the table that are specified in the config.txt file
			inside the psiturk project. Luckily, psiturk has already build in a data extraction tool and
			therefore you will hopefully not have to deal with accessing the database directly. If you do
			need to look at the database, I recommend the tool <a href="http://www.sequelpro.com/">Sequel Pro.</a>.
			PsiTurk's tool for extracting the data is used from within the psiTurk terminal, and is the invoked
			via the command <span class="prettyprint">download_datafiles</span>. I have found that if there are entries in the table that have 
			null values in the datastring column the command fails. This can be fixed using Sequel Pro and 
			manually deleting those entries. If you do do that, there is a status column and really you only want
			entries with status four, so I delete all other entries. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<span class="prettyprint">download_datafiles</span> will generate three different files, but for our
			purposes all we need is questiondata.csv. This file contains all of the saved data from jgl, but needs
			a bit of reformatting to end up with a nice .mat file. This is where the tools in the data directory
			of the jgl distribution come in handy. The first thing that needs to be done is getData.bash needs to be
			run. getData.bash needs to be in the <b>same folder</b> as questiondata.csv for it to work. It will then
			generate a folder called xmls which will contain a bunch of XML files, one per participant. To then save 
			the data in these XMLs as .mat files the command makeAllMats needs to be run in matlab. <b>NOTE:</b> all
			three .m files in the data folder need to be in the same folder as questiondata.csv for the command to work.
			makeAllMats will generate a .mat file for each participant, now all is needed is your normal data analysis tools
			on the .mat files.

			A note about improvement: I would recommend streamlining this process a bit more meaning, creating a script that
			runs all of these programs in quick succession to end up with the .mat files in one quick sweap. This issue with that
			is jgl would have to be installed in a standard place in the file structure so that all the paths were correct. As
			of now the tools work great, but there is room for improvement.
