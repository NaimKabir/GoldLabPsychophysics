			Before we get started with how to start you experiment it is
			important to highlight a major difference between the way that mgl
			and jgl opperate. This is in the use of phases. While mgl has phases,
			they are rarely used, with jgl you will find yourself using phases
			quite a bit. A phase is used every time a different webpage needs to
			be displayed, with the exception of an instruction phase which can
			have multiple pages, more on that later. Since many phases will not
			actually contain a stimulus it is important to know how to control
			the flow between them. This will be explained <a
				href="tutorial-Working with surveys.html">here</a>.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div>
		<p>The first thing all experiments need is a global myscreen
			variable. This is done by calling initScreen, and saving its return
			value as window.myscreen. Once the myscreen variable is setup the
			task array can be initialized.</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint"> 
window.myscreen = initScreen(); 
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>After myscreen is initialized, the task array has to be
			initialized. It is important, as with myscreen, that the task array
			be called "task" The following is how to initialize the 2-D array.</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
window.task = [];
task[0] = [];
task[0][0] = ...
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Once the task array is setup, each phase of each task has to be
			initialized. Note, tasks are a collection of phases as in mgl,
			therefore the first dimension of the task array are the tasks, the
			second dimension is a collection of phases within that task. Note, If
			the experiment contains multiple tasks, task[1] much be initialized
			using task[1] = []; There are three main different types of phases,
			survey phases, stimulus phases, and instruction phases. stimulus
			phases are initialized in the same way as they are in mgl with one
			main exception, the require a html field, and a usingScreen field.
			Here is how they are to be initialized:</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
task[0][0] = {};
task[0][0].seglen = [10, 2];
task[0][0].html = "canvas.html";
task[0][0].usingScreen = 1;
task[0][0] = initTask(task[0][0], startSegmentCallback, updateScreenCallback);
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Survey phases are setup a bit differently, the only thing that
			is specified for a survey phase is the html page, and that much come
			after the call to initSurvey(); Below is an example:</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
task[0][1] = initSurvey();
task[0][1].html = "survey.html";
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Instruction phases are again, slightly different from survey
			phases. Instruction phases require a call to initInstructions to set
			them up. Additionally, initInstructions takes a list of html
			instruction pages as a parameter. This means that before the setup of
			the phase the creation of this list is required. Here is how it is
			done:</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
var instruction-pages = ["instruct-1.html", "instruct-2.html", "instruct-ready.html"];
task[0][2] = initInstructions(instruction-pages);
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>After the phases are initialized all of the stimuli must be
			initialized using initStimulus. First off, all stimuli must be global
			variable, i.e. fields of the window object. This is done in the same
			ways as with myscreen and task. Additionally, if you want the
			stimulus object to be saved at the end of the experiment it is
			crucial that initStimulus be called where the parameter is the string
			version of the variable name. If this is unclear, hopefully this
			example will straighten things out. In the code that follows, two
			stimuli are initialized, one called stimulus and the other called
			face.</p>

		<pre class="prettyprint">
window.stimulus = {};
initStimulus('stimulus');
window.face = {};
initStimulus('face');
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>As the last thing before the experiment is started, initTurk()
			must be called. This function sets up some basic functionality for
			the turk. It saves the Id of the user, preloads the pages, and sets
			up the psiTurk object. The experiment will not function without this
			function call!!</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint"> 
initTurk(); 
		</pre>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Once the turk has been initialized all that is left is to start
			the experiement. Here is where there is a big difference between jgl
			and mgl. Here, there is no display loop. JavaScript is not allowed to
			control the browser in the way that mgl is allowed to control the
			computer and therefore a while loop than ran the entire duration of
			the experiment was impossible. Instead, all that is needed is a call
			to startPhase for each task that is being run. That means, if there
			are two tasks startPhase must be called twice, once for each task.
			Here is an example, since we have only setup one task in this
			experiment, all that is needed is the following:</p>
		<pre class="prettyprint">
startPhase(task[0]); 
		</pre>
	</div>
