# GoldLabPsychophysics
All human psychophysics tasks created during my time at Gold Lab

The **FoundationCode** folder includes Snowdots by Ben Heasley, Psychtoolbox, Stanford's MGL Library, the Tobii SDK, and other assorted Matlab toolboxes. The Custom folder features code that was written by me or by colleagues at the GoldLab. These are all **REQUIRED** to be in the Matlab path for the task code to work!

#The Tasks
*AudioRTTask:* This is an audio reaction time task. A signal sound is played through the left or right ear, and the participant must press the left or right trigger to signify where the sound came from. The following experimental interventions are included: an auditory distractor, effort modulation, and split hazard rates. Read the folder's readme for more information.

*Audio2AFCTask:* Audio version of Dr. Chris Glaze's triangles task (http://elifesciences.org/content/4/e08825v2)  with a twist. There are two different hazard rates dictating how often sounds play from left or right, and a metahazard rate switching between the hazard rates. For more details, check out the task folder's specific readme.

***

*CalibrationTask:* This is a task meant to imitate the actual calibration at the Lucas Labs' monkey labs. It's a reaction time task where research participants press a button as fast as a cue on-screen changes color. For more details, check out that folder's readme.

***

*HeartRateTask:* This is a completely passive listening task, meant to coordinate eye signals with physiological signs recorded from the BioPac. The prime feature is a time synchronizer that sends and receives TTL pulses from another computer to synchronize the BioPac and Eyetracker data streams. For more details, check out the readme in that folder.
